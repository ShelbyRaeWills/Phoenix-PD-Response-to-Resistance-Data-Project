Phoenix Police Department Response to Resistance Data is fairly new, only providing data back to 2018. It is now available on the City of Phoenixâ€™s open data website, and is sometimes referred to as use of force data. They have five different summaries: incident details, officer summary, individual summary, race and ethnicity summary, and incident summary. I used a joined version of the data provided by Sarah Cohen, which is available upon request at srwills1@asu.edu.
